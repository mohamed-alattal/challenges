#Frontend Followprice Challenges
Welcome to followprice challenges for frontend jobs.

If you are here it's most likely that we already have some knowledge about you, but if it isn't the case, and you are willing to try to get a job in Followprice, you are free to try to solve one of our problems and present yourself to us.

This is not a final exam. There are not right or wrong solutions. 

The challenges try to be the most technology and methodology agnostic possible, you are free to use whatever you want in the way you want, although we suggest you to use technologies that we already use in our stack. 

Try to use a language that our dev team is familiar with: python, java, javascript, c, c++. If you want to use another language please ask us first.

This is only a way for us to know you better (how you work, how you communicate, how you solve problems) and for you know the kind of problems we face in Followprice. 

During the process, you can talk to us. Explain your doubts, say what are you thinking to do to solve the problem.
