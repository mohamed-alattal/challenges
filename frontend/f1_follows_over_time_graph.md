# Follows over time graph
A store with a followprice button has access to a store application where among other stuff they can access a simple dashboard with useful information (number of followers, the most followed products, etc). 
An useful insight for stores is the possibility to check the progress of the number of follows of their products.

## The Problem
For answer this need you may build a reusable (the same component should be reused to show the progress of other things, like the number of notifications, referrals, etc) graph where using a given dataset may result into a nice graphic which can be shown by day, week, month.


```
{
  teste: 1
}
```

## Background information

## Other Requirements
Altough our challenges are technology agnostic and you are free to use whatever you want, we strongly recommend to use the techs we use on our stack and solutions with it will be valued.

Recommended technologies:
- HTML5
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 
- Javascript (if [ES6](http://es6-features.org/) bonus)
- [D3](https://d3js.org/) (if [reactd3](http://www.reactd3.org/) bonus)
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) (bonus)
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/index.html) (bonus)

In this challenge we recomend you to create a simple __React__ Component (or more than one if you think it would make sense) and make use of __reactd3__ to build the graph. Using React+Redux would be a great bonus.
