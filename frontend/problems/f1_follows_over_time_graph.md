#(F1) Follows Over Time Graph
A store with a followprice button has access to a store application where among other stuff they can access a simple dashboard with useful information (number of followers, the most followed products, etc). 
An useful insight for stores is the possibility to check the progress of the number of follows of their products.

## The Problem
*Example:*

Eglobal sent a newsletter for its whole subscribers announcing the Followprice feature. After this marketing action they want to know if the number of the follows increased and if is it worth to make this kind of publicity.

Take in consideration:
- The graph must show the number of follows during the time.
- We suggest you to use [json server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to simulate API calls.
- In Background Information you have a example of the received data. If you think there would be a better data structure, please feel free to suggest.
- The built component must be reusable for other data (example: progress referrals over time)
- Must be possible to see different views of the progress: daily, weekly and monthly.
- Automated tests are valued.


## Background information

Example of a received data:
```
{
  follows:[
    {
      date: "15/04/2016",
      count: 4
    },
    {
      date: "14/04/2016",
      count: 9
    },
    {
      date: "13/04/2016",
      count: 2
    },
    {
      date: "10/04/2016",
      count: 14
    }
  ]
}
```

## Other Requirements
Altough our challenges are __technology agnostic__ and you are free to use whatever you want, we suggest to use the technologies we already use on our stack. Solutions built with it may be valued.

In this challenge we recomend you to create a simple __React__ Component (or more than one if you think it would make sense) and make use of __reactd3__ to build the graph. Using React+Redux would be a great bonus.

Our technologies:
- HTML5
- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 
- Javascript ([ES6](http://es6-features.org/))
- [D3](https://d3js.org/) ([reactd3](http://www.reactd3.org/))
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) 
- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/index.html)
