### FrontEnd Challenge

# List of Follows

#### Goal

Convert an interface drawn on Photoshop to a rich client-side web interface.
This interface is a simple list of follows that a single user has on his/her personal area. It can be downloaded [here](http://invis.io/a/681JJDB2M7GHK).

We'll mainly evaluate the compliance with the technological requirements, the code quality and the solution modularity and extendability.

#### Technological Requirements

* The delivered solution must use:
    - HTML5
    - JavaScript/JQuery
    - [Sass]
    - [Bootstrap 3.0]
    - [React]  with the [Flux] architecture
    - Any other javascript library that could improve the solution

* The solution must be the closest match to the given drawing (on a pixel scale)

* The sort and search functionality included in the drawing must be implemented.

* The solution should be extendable in order to add other visualization types of the same follow list, e.g. Grid visualization.

#### Suggestions

* User the [Reflux] library to get a cleaner and faster implementation of the Flux architecture.

* Use a JSON with dummy data for each follow, assuming that the data for the list of follows came from a Followprice API.

#### Delivering

To deliver the solution you must fork this project, develop the solution in this folder and make a pull request when you think it is complete.
