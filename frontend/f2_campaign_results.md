# Campaign Results
Followprice gives to the stores the possibility of create directed campaigns. The stores can send a discount coupon to specific categories of products that are being followed. Imagine the category "Smartphones" that is being used by 2000 users, that means there are 2000 persons waiting for a simple price drop to buy. This is a really valued feature and there is a need to show the results of a campaign in the nicest way possible.
